        <p class="text-muted">Being socially active can be as beneficial as being physically active. Keeping this in mind, as a part of Trika'20, we had been up with the venture 'Mathrusanthwanam'. Mathrusanthwanam was an initiative to visit the old age homes every months and engage those pure souls into a world of colour and joy. A merry-full gathering of our students, helped them stay emotionally strong and makes them feel connected to the world around them. As a first step, a visit to Injuvila Old Age Home was held on 2nd February 2020. Holding up 
          those wrinkled hands, sitting with the tired hearts and pacifying them, 'Mathrusanthwanam'  surely rejuvenated those innocent souls.

      <p class="text-muted">“Dreams become regrets when left in the mind”. Talented young minds are not able to achieve their dreams just because of lack of availability of resources for them. Hence to motivate them, to guide them in the path of achieving their goals, STEPS was up with a venture. A scholarship exam was planned for school students and the scholarship amount received could be utilized by them to receive appropriate coaching to achieve their dream course.
        The students in the top 5 positions were awarded a scholarship amount of Rs 5000 which could certainly add a lot to their path of achieving success</p>

              Step by step they make progress,
              from an infant to an adult. Being the makers of tomorrow, today's children are to be greatly motivated and taught about the values we need to uphold. 
              At Trika'20, we had the students of Children's Home, who were welcomed to witness a saga of events. Cultural programs, games, stalls and a lot awaited them at Little Feats. A platform, to showcase their talents, from where they could get inspiration to hold on. Holding those tiny hands, helping them make successive footsteps, we aimed to make them soar with flying colours. Thus Little Feats was on in which one met the most innocent souls and diluted the salt of humanity in them.

              Though constitution grants equal rights for every people, including the LGBTQ community, the fights we do to attain it is of great shame to the nation. Being a country that upholds unity in diversity, the sad face is that certain diversities are marginalized and kept to a corner. Be it education or employment, the struggles they face is high. 
              Being the need of the hour to recognise them and to keep them along with us, the humanitarian souls of TKMCE  united for hosting 'Sweekruthi' at Trika'20. Sweekruthi welcomed the transgender community in Kollam, to address the issues faced by them and to spread the message of brotherhood among our fellow beings. We are the generation who could do something about this burning social issue.

To ride you through his way of attaining success and interact with the students, we had at TRIKA'20, Mr.Krishnakumar for LET'S TALK. A blogger, motivational speaker and a Spinal Muscular Dystrophy Type 2 patient, he has an extraordinary personality and is the right example to make us believe, there are no barriers that could stop us from success.

              Passing down the knowledge you have is like lighting others lives. Helping out the palliative patients who have been cornered by their ill health, to gain a skill which they could use to make a livelihood, the satisfaction we could gain is immensely high. Skill acquisition programs to make them master certain skills like embroidery, candle making, laddu making and many more were hosted as part of Trika'20. Also we have training sessions for the Kudumbashree members for making solar lamps. 
SKILL ACQUISITION PROGRAMS was the place where veils of ignorance were removed by knowledge and shackles of avoidance broken by acceptance.

              The world is a rainbow with different types of people, different races, different visions and different likes. Among these gifted are those specially abled children. Breaking the shackles of their limitations, they have arised to the forefront, which inspires many lives. 
At Trika'20 we had a flock of specially abled children for Varnangal, where colours are added to those gifted lives. Varnangal was a place where people witnessed the true spirits and talents exhibited by God's favourite creations which humidified their hearts.

              Step by step they make progress,
              from an infant to an adult. Being the makers of tomorrow, today's children are to be greatly motivated and taught about the values we need to uphold. 
              At Trika'20, we had the students of Children's Home, who were welcomed to witness a saga of events. Cultural programs, games, stalls and a lot awaited them at Little Feats. A platform, to showcase their talents, from where they could get inspiration to hold on. Holding those tiny hands, helping them make successive footsteps, we aimed to make them soar with flying colours. Thus Little Feats was on in which one met the most innocent souls and diluted the salt of humanity in them.

              A training session for the visually impaired was  conducted in association with ‘Jyothirgamaya foundation’ run by Ms. Tiffany Brar. The main focus of the session was the practice of using electronic equipment having potential to assist them like mobile phones, computers etc. Blindness is only for their eyes, no to their brains. Training them to use the latest gadgets is the need of the hour as each second the world is getting more digitalized.

              Humans are the best books to read on. Owning the best and bitter experiences, having learnt the lessons of life from them, humans themselves are an encyclopedia to ponder on. 
              At Trika'20, we had 'Human Library', wherein the most valuable personalities around us from various backgrounds were welcomed to share their experiences which certainly sumed up to life lessons. 
              Niyog Krishna, 26 year old Keralite who is the first Indian to be qualified for the famed Fjallraven Polar Arctic adventure trip, armed with his experiences of trekking in the Himalayas, biking the country criss-cross was at TKM to share his travel stories with us. Priyesh K V, 30 year old well experienced fisherman from Kozhikode district who proved himself to be the real nature lover was with us to narrate his journey in removing 3.5 tonnes of plastic from the sea all by himself. We also had the passionate couple Vijayan and Mohana who ran a teashop in the heart of Kochi, managing their life at minimum expenditures and travelled 23 countries so far.

              in mind, as a part of Trika '20, we had been up with the venture 'Mathrusanthwanam'. Mathrusanthwanam was
              an initiative to visit the old age homes every months and engage those pure souls into a world of colour
              and joy. A merry-full gathering of our students, helped them stay emotionally strong and makes them feel
              connected to the world around them. As a first step, a visit to Injuvila Old Age Home was held on 2nd
              February 2020. Holding up
              those wrinkled hands, sitting with the tired hearts and pacifying them, 'Mathrusanthwanam' surely
              rejuvenated those innocent souls.<br>

              was planned for school students and the scholarship amount received could be utilized by them to receive
              appropriate coaching to achieve their dream course.The students in the top 5 positions were awarded a

              Step by step they make progress,
              from an infant to an adult. Being the makers of tomorrow, today's children are to be greatly motivated and
              taught about the values we need to uphold.
              At Trika '20, we had the students of Children's Home, who were welcomed to witness a saga of events.
              Cultural programs, games, stalls and a lot awaited them at Little Feats. A platform, to showcase their
              talents, from where they could get inspiration to hold on. Holding those tiny hands, helping them make
              successive footsteps, we aimed to make them soar with flying colours. Thus Little Feats was on in which
              one met the most innocent souls and diluted the salt of humanity in them.

              Though constitution grants equal rights for every people, including the LGBTQ community, the fights we do
              to attain it is of great shame to the nation. Being a country that upholds unity in diversity, the sad
              face is that certain diversities are marginalized and kept to a corner. Be it education or employment, the
              struggles they face is high.
              Being the need of the hour to recognise them and to keep them along with us, the humanitarian souls of
              TKMCE united for hosting 'Sweekruthi' at Trika '20. Sweekruthi welcomed the transgender community in
              Kollam, to address the issues faced by them and to spread the message of brotherhood among our fellow
              beings. We are the generation who could do something about this burning social issue.

              We are part of a generation owning immense potential but filled with a huge proportion who are afraid of
              even trying something because of fear of failure and giving up dreams without even thinking of
              alternatives. To ride you through his way of attaining success and interact with the students, we had at
              TRIKA '20, Mr.Krishnakumar for LET'S TALK. A blogger, motivational speaker and a Spinal Muscular Dystrophy
              Type 2 patient, he has an extraordinary personality and is the right example to make us believe, there are

              skills like embroidery, candle making, laddu making and many more were hosted as part of Trika '20. Also
              we have training sessions for the Kudumbashree members for making solar lamps.
              SKILL ACQUISITION PROGRAMS was the place where veils of ignorance were removed by knowledge and shackles

              "Children are not things to be moulded, but persons to be unfolded"
              Step by step they make progress,
              from an infant to an adult. Being the makers of tomorrow, today's children are to be greatly motivated and
              taught about the values we need to uphold.
              At Trika '20, we had the students of Children's Home, who were welcomed to witness a saga of events.
              Cultural programs, games, stalls and a lot awaited them at Little Feats. A platform, to showcase their
              talents, from where they could get inspiration to hold on. Holding those tiny hands, helping them make
              successive footsteps, we aimed to make them soar with flying colours. Thus Little Feats was on in which
              one met the most innocent souls and diluted the salt of humanity in them.

              A training session for the visually impaired was conducted in association with ‘Jyothirgamaya foundation’
              run by Ms. Tiffany Brar. The main focus of the session was the practice of using electronic equipment
              having potential to assist them like mobile phones, computers etc. Blindness is only for their eyes, no to
              their brains. Training them to use the latest gadgets is the need of the hour as each second the world is
              getting more digitalized.

              Humans are the best books to read on. Owning the best and bitter experiences, having learnt the lessons of
              life from them, humans themselves are an encyclopedia to ponder on.
              At Trika '20, we had 'Human Library', wherein the most valuable personalities around us from various
              backgrounds were welcomed to share their experiences which certainly sumed up to life lessons.
              Niyog Krishna, 26 year old Keralite who is the first Indian to be qualified for the famed Fjallraven Polar
              Arctic adventure trip, armed with his experiences of trekking in the Himalayas, biking the country
              criss-cross was at TKM to share his travel stories with us. Priyesh K V, 30 year old well experienced
              fisherman from Kozhikode district who proved himself to be the real nature lover was with us to narrate
              his journey in removing 3.5 tonnes of plastic from the sea all by himself. We also had the passionate
              couple Vijayan and Mohana who ran a teashop in the heart of Kochi, managing their life at minimum
              expenditures and travelled 23 countries so far.

              IMPRINT was an idea presentation competition held during TRIKA '20 on 9th February, 2020 conducted by IEEE
              SB TKMCE in collaboration with STEPS.The topic of the programme was 'Tackling the Climate Crisis'. The
              main objective of the event was to make environmental concerns in the budding engineers.The judgement was
              mainly based on the ideas of the enthusiastic minds rather than the development of existing solutions.

              Proper health for the mind is as important as maintaining good body health. A sound mind keeps a sound
              body alive. In a fast paced life, when our students are facing great stress, we the students of TKMCE is
              up with a solution at TRIKA '20. A consultancy of well known clinical psychologist Dr.Manav was provided
              as part of District Mental Health Program, at the counselling and psychologist room near Amenities centre.
              People made proper use of this opportunity to get out of the stress covering them and for their burning
              spirits to pop out.
